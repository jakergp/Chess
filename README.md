# Chess
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
Chess game mae with SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for C++. It is developed 
using Object-Oriented Programming which is one of the basic features of C++. To move the 
pieces you simply have to click in one of your pieces (either white or black) and then 
select one of the possible squares that your piece can move. When you select a piece 
the board will display all the possible movements. I used various data structures to 
develop this game trying to make as efficient as possible. Some features are not 
implemented like detection of check-mate but this is something that the players can see 
and it is not completely neccesary. A match of chess can be played without any issue. 
All the pieces are derived form a parent class, trying to take advantage of all the OOP 
features. This was a fun project to make because I understood many things about game 
development and despite this being a simple game some issues came while doing it, thats 
why it is important to plan ahead your projects.
