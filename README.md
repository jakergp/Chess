#### Description:
Chess game made with SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for C++. It is developed using Object-Oriented Programming which is one of the basic features of C++. To move your pieces you simply have to click in one of them (either white or black) and then select one of the possible squares that your piece can move, the game is implemented with the regular chess rules. When you select a piece the board will display all the possible movements. It uses various data structures trying to be as efficient as possible. Some features are not implemented like auto-detection of check-mate but this is something that the players can notice by themselves and it is not fundamental. A match of chess can be played without any issue. All the pieces are derived form a parent class, trying to take advantage of all the OOP features. This was a fun project to make because I understood many things about game development and despite this being a simple game some issues came while doing it, that's why it is important to plan ahead your projects and have a clear structure of what you want to do.
